Semester Grade Calculator

This application calculates your semester grade based on two quarter grades and your exam grade.

Usage


Enter your quarter 1 grade, quarter 2 grade, and exam grade into the respective input fields. The application will then calculate your semester grade and display it on the page.

Note that the input fields only accept values between 0 and 101 for quarter grades, and between 0 and 100 for exam grade. If you enter an invalid grade, the application will display an error message.

Resetting the Input Fields

To reset the input fields, click the "RESET" button. This will clear all entered grades and reset the semester grade output to its default message.

This project was inspired by the need to quickly calculate semester grades.
