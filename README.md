Semester Grade Calculator

This is a web application that calculates your semester grade based on your quarter 1 and quarter 2 grades, as well as your exam grade.
Installation

To use this application, simply download the repository and open the index.html file in your web browser.


Usage


Enter your quarter 1 grade, quarter 2 grade, and exam grade into the respective input fields. The application will then calculate your semester grade and display it on the page.

Note that the input fields only accept values between 0 and 101 for quarter grades, and between 0 and 100 for exam grade. If you enter an invalid grade, the application will display an error message.
Resetting the Input Fields
